# OpenSound
Opens Windows 10 sound options that were previously accessible from the bottom right sound icon.


Download and run either (or both) OpenSound.exe or OpenSound.bat

Windows 10 has some problems with my .exe so I recommend the .bat file.

<strong>Download:</strong>

<a href="https://github.com/YeloPartyHat/OpenSound/blob/master/OpenSound.exe" download> OpenSound.exe </a>


Enjoy!
